These datasets and concept were collected and created by [Libby Wu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/libbywu/), as part of a project for 2023 English course, [City Fictions](https://english.fas.harvard.edu/english-184cf-city-fictions-0), taught by [Tara Menon](https://www.tarakmenon.com/). 

There is an assignment in the course where students are tasked with creating two distinct maps which each give a different impression of a place, as a complement to their work engaging with how place is represented in literature.

This assignment -- not limited by any format, but often leveraging GIS datasets and tools, has been developed and supported in partnership with the Harvard Map Collection. Libby has made her data and methods open, towards helping the library better support future student projects. 

In this repository, you will find the point datasets Libby created for her project -- two maps of NYC which look at leisure, athletics/recreation, and income:
- [NYC Basketball Courts Map](https://felt.com/map/NYC-Basketball-Courts-b4zDKvxIRiaJHw8AuD4AxC?loc=40.71992,-73.97417,13.68z&share=1)
- [NYC Workout Classes Map](https://felt.com/map/NYC-Workout-Classes-fYRDJL4tS0q59AWu81qGCXA?loc=40.71574,-73.98585,13.51z&share=1)

Libby created the [NYC workout class dataset](https://github.com/HarvardMapCollection/basketball-fitness-example/blob/main/nyc-fitness-classes.geojson) manually, using the many different types of studios (boxing, cycling, pilates, yoga, etc) listed via a [ClassPass](https://classpass.com/) subscription.

Libby downloaded the [basketball courts](https://github.com/HarvardMapCollection/basketball-fitness-example/blob/main/nyc-basketball-courts.geojson) from [nycgovparks.org](https://www.nycgovparks.org/facilities/basketball), augmenting the city published file with a bit of her own research on notable/historical courts. 

The subway lines come from [NYC Open Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/), and the income demographic data is via the [Opportunity Atlas](https://www.opportunityatlas.org/).
